/**@brief (Blackadder Core) The PLA Element implements the PLA function. Currently it supports the basic LIPSIN mechanism.
 * 
 * It can work in two modes. In a MAC mode it expects ethernet frames from the network devices. It checks the LIPSIN identifiers and pushes packets to another Ethernet interface or to the Forwarder.
 * In IP mode, the PLA expects raw IP sockets as the underlying network. Note that a mixed mode is currently not supported. Some lines must be written.
