In order to make this software invoke

$ make
$ sudo make install

The complication optimisation level can be configured via the argument OPT, e.g.:

$ make OPT=O3

The following system libraries are required:

- libboost-program-options-dev (--help argument has been implemented using this
library)
- libboost-thread-dev (creating threads and thread groups)
- liblog4cxx10-dev (Class-based logging)
- libnet1-dev (send IP packets to IP end-points)
- libpcap-dev (capture packets on local interface)

Additionally, several libraries are required which are included in Blackadder
and must be made prior to the compilation of the NAP:
- Blackadder
- MOLY

They can be found in blackadder/lib and blackadder/lib/moly.

WHen installing the nap binary make copies all required configuration files to
/etc/nap. To uninstall the NAP simply invoke

$ sudo make uninstall

which removes all files from /etc/nap and deletes the corresponding folder. The
log file located in /var/log/nap.log will be also removed from the file system.
