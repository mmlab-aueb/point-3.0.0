BLACKADDER TOPOLOGY AUTOGENERATOR
==================================

    This is the README file for the source code of the blackadder topology and configuration
file autogenerator. For more information or any enquiries please email Mohammed Al-Khalidi at
mshawk@essex.ac.uk



   The blackadder topology and configuration file autogenerator is an R language script written
for the purpose of generating a random blackadder topology with random node connectivity degree 
and thereafter creating a *.cfg configuration file ready to be used by the blackadder deployment 
tool. The script is solely for the purpose of facilitating NS3-blackadder simulations of large 
scale networks eliminating the time and complexity needed for manually generating large configu-
ration files. Please read the notes below which will explain how to use the script:

- You will need to have R language installed on your machine and make sure to install "graph" and 
"igraph" packages within R as well.        

- You can use any random graph generator function you like and any number of nodes as long as you 
convert your graph into graphNEL form after that as illustrated in the script. The function used 
in the script as an example is a barabasi game random graph generator with 100 nodes.

- Make sure you use undirected links in your graph generation so links will be identified both 
ways and translated into the configuration file correctly. Also make sure your function doesn't
generate loops (connection with the node itself) or isolated nodes with no connections. This 
will help simulate a more realistic topology and avoid any errors in creating the configuration
file.

- The role of all the nodes in the generated configuration file are forwarders and no TM or RV node
is specified. This is to leave you with the ability to freely assign the TM, RV role as appropriate 
for your simulation.

- No publisher or subscriber app. is specified in the generated configuration file, this is also to
let you decide your simulation requirement, network traffic load and desired output freely.

- The generated configuration file named ns3_topology.cfg can be found in your default R workspace 
after running the script.
